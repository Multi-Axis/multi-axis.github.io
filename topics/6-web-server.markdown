# Backend server (Gobbix?)

This server (written in Go) handles passing data to and from html/javascript [front end](https://github.com/Multi-Axis/multi-axis-graphs/wiki/Server-view-front-end-notes) and dashboard to the [Habbix back end](https://github.com/Multi-Axis/multi-axis-graphs/blob/master/Doc/Habbix.md) and the [multi-axis database](https://github.com/Multi-Axis/multi-axis-graphs/blob/master/Doc/DatabaseAndData.md).

Server [source code.](https://github.com/Multi-Axis/multi-axis-graphs/blob/master/zab2.go)

Using `deploy.sh` to deploy the server is recommended. Compiling  requires [this postgres driver](https://github.com/lib/pq). 

* URL:s ending with `[ip]:8080/dashboard` will lead to dashboard. 
* `[ip]:8080/static/` is used to deliver javascript and css files.
* `[ip]:8080/item/:server/:item` (for example *item/ohtu1/cpu*) leads to specific graphs for items, and is also currently (somewhat stupidly) used to deliver JSON files which has some "amusing" side effects with client-side web caching. 
* Incorrect URL:s will result in 404 errors.





###Known issues and whatnot.

* `/dashboard` is used instead of `/` because using the latter occasionally had `itemHandler` to also call for `dashboardHandler` (!?)
* dashboard's sql query is a tad slow.
* The server is *probably* protected against typical sql injection attacks, but will happily send all kinds of wacky stuff from front end's *"Model details"* field to the forecast models, so be warned.
* Currently most errors are handled elegantly by `log.Fatal(err)`, e.g. server dies on purpose if something goes wrong. This includes problems with the database or Habbix...
